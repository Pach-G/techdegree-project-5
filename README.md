###An Interactive Photo Gallery 

In this project, I Created an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and CSS Grid Layout. At the top of the page, you'll have a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox, and a caption. There is a  "back" and "previous" arrows to cycle through photos, and an exit button.
